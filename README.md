Page Speed: For all the page optimisation analysis, I have used Google's Lighthouse tool and Page Speed Insights to analysze the page load time, along with how well it performs as per web standards. I have also used GTMetrix to cross-check the same. On a laptop browser, the time to be interactive is 0.5 seconds for the Homepage, as well as the SQL Editor page.

External Libraries Used: 

1. tailwindcss:Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file. 
2. react-hot-toast: React Hot Toast is a library that aims to include toast notifications in your React applications easily and intuitively. It's a three-step process to add the simplest of all notifications in your app.
